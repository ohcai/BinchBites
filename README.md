# Who are the Binches? 
The Binches (Hannah, Raiche, Jaica, and Cailley) are a group of four friends who turned into family back in elementary school. Our name came from a cookie brand called "Binch" that actually stood for "Biscuits n Chocolate". Being immature kids, we thought it would be funny to name ourselves after a cookie that sounds like a bad word! Even though we're older now (yet still immature), the name stuck. We share a love for food... especially boba, soups, and rice! We love trying out new places together and are passionate for photography, film, cooking/baking, graphic design, and of course eating. What better way to combine our interests and document our travels than through a food review Instagram page? Fun Fact! We actually created BinchBites as a joke during the pandemic, but realized it was actually kinda fun being "food critics"! We hope we can be just as cool as Mr. Marchant, our AP Computer Science and Physics teacher who also loves to post his food adventures! :)

# What do we do?
Although we may not be the most consistent in posting, we go out to eat and go on boba runs for serotonin **A LOT**. Each time we go to a new spot, we love to take pictures of what we're eating and post our opinion on the food. Since there are four of us, we typically each get a different item and make our review based on if we reccomend the item or not. Afterwards, we post our critiques on our Instagram page and tag the place we tried. Our favorite part of posting is getting attention from the actual business and getting reposted by them. Additionally, we recently created our first video reviewing ube flavored desserts from Cafe 86 to celebrate Filipino American History Month. Our video, "Ubussin or Ubad", will be airing on our school's live stream soon, but stay tuned for more potential videos on the BinchBites page!

# Where have we been?
We've traveled all throughout California together- from San Francisco to San Diego and everywhere in between. We have also gone to various states like Hawaii and Arizona and are on a mission to go to other countries to try their cuisines. Recently, we've visited Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Mission Bay, San Diego, and Jamaica! Some of our favorite spots we've reviewed on our page include TPTea in Berkeley, Matcha Cafe Maiko in Japantown SF, and Ozen Sushi in Norwalk, California.
