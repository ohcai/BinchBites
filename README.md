<h1> Who are the Binches? </h1>
<p> The Binches are a group of four friends: Hannah, Raiche, Jaica, and Cailley, who became family back in elementary school. Our name came from a cookie called "Binch" that actually stood for "Biscuits n Chocolate". Being immature kids, we thought it would be funny to name ourselves after a cookie that sounds like a bad word! Even though we're older now (and still immature), the name stuck. We share a love for food... especially boba, soups, and rice! We love trying out new places together and are passionate for photography, film, cooking, graphic design, and of course eating, so what better way to document our adventures than through a food review Instagram page? </p>

<h1> What do we do? </h1>
<p> We go out to eat and get boba for serotonin A LOT. Each time we go to a spot, we love to take pictures of what we're eating and post our opinion on the food.    </p>

<h1> Where have we been? </h1>
<p> We've traveled all throughout California- from San Francisco to San Diego and everywhere in between. We have also gone to various states and are on a mission to go to other countries to try their cuisines. Recently, we've visited Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Mission Bay, San Diego, and Jamaica! Some of our favorite spots include TPTea in Berkeley, Matcha Cafe Maiko in Japantown SF, and Ozen Sushi in Norwalk, California. Even though we aren't the most consistent in posting, we're always eating. Follow us on Instagram for more BinchBites content!
